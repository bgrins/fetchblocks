,"This specification defines an API that allows websites to declare themselves as web share targets, which can receive shared content from either the Web Share API, or system events (e.g., shares from native apps). This is a similar mechanism to navigator.registerProtocolHandler, in that it works by registering the website with the user agent, to later be invoked from another site or native application via the user agent (possibly at the discretion of the user). The difference is that registerProtocolHandler registers the handler via a programmatic API, whereas a Web Share Target is declared in the Web App Manifest, to be registered at a time of the user agent or user's choosing.",web-share-target,https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1476515,worth prototyping,"This specification affords web applications the ability to handle user-initiated 'share' actions (e.g., sharing a link, image, text, or other media) in contexts that have traditionally been the exclusive domain of native and/or system applications.

Some basic Web Thing Types are provided and additional types can be defined using semantic extensions with JSON-LD. In addition to this specification there is a note on Web Thing API Protocol Bindings which proposes non-normative bindings of the Web Thing API to various existing IoT protocols.
